***Does the higher level of sugar percentiles line up with the higher win percents?
```{r}
ggplot(data = candy, aes(x = winpercent, y = sugarpercent)) + 
  geom_point(color='blue') +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = 'red')
```
***As we can see there is a slight correltion between the winpercent and sugarpercent. So we can say that the higher levels of sugar the more people will like it.
